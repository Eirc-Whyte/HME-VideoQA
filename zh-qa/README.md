Please refer to this repo for my code to extract [[Youtube2text-QA dataset]](https://github.com/fanchenyou/EgoVQA/blob/master/pretrain.py).
I want to express me special thanks to authors of this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06355) for generously offering this dataset.
In the above link, please take a look at data_zhqa instructions for downloading the raw data and vocabulary, as well as the pretrain.py for running 
various VideoQA methods.
